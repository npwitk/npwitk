My name is **Nonprawich Intakaew**, but you can call me **Google** (yes, like the search engine!). Currently, I’m a student at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT) (Computer Engineering), Thammasat University. I'm here to share a little about myself, my projects, and more. (Though I joined GitHub a while back, I haven’t been updating it regularly—until now, lol!)

### 🎓 About Me

- **Education**: 2nd Year **Computer Engineer** student at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat University, Thailand
- **Interest in Tech**: I’ve been in love with technology since I was a kid! I remember making HTML websites to sell stuff online when I was about 7 years old. Spoiler alert: it didn’t really work out, but hey, at least I was trying, righttttt? 😂 Over the years, I’ve done a ton of projects, but my heart belongs to Apple. I adore everything about them—their design, their philosophy. When asked who my idol was back in the day, I’d proudly say, “Steve Jobs!” Later, I discovered Swift, and through a lot of self-learning, I even won the **WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge**. How cool is that? _(Craig's voice)_
- **Personality**: A bit of a perfectionist (sometimes, no, most of the time) and funny! (Gosh, I never thought I would describe myself that way).

### 🎨 Hobbies & Interests

- **Daydreaming** 🌌: It might sound funny, but I’m known to drift into my own world quite a bit. Some of my best ideas come from these moments!
- **Taking Photos** 📸: I’m always ready to snap a pic of anything and everything—there’s just so much to capture! I’m a bit obsessed with film cameras, and I might have a slight problem with buying too much film just to capture those "once-in-a-lifetime" moments (or maybe just my friends).
- **Apple News Reporter** 🍏📰: When there’s an Apple Event, I’m like, “That’s my day!” I have to stay up all night (because, you know, living in +7 means events happen around midnight) to watch Apple Event. I love sharing the latest updates, whether it’s WWDC or product event. I’ll summarize everything and blast it out on my Instagram stories or Twitter—because who doesn’t want to hear all about the newest technologies at 3 AM? 🤣

### 🎧 Favorite Music & Artists

- **Favorite Artist**: `let myFavoriteArtist =` [Taylor Swift](https://music.apple.com/th/artist/taylor-swift/159260351). I also love [Olivia Rodrigo](https://music.apple.com/th/artist/olivia-rodrigo/979458609), [Gracie Abrams](https://music.apple.com/th/artist/gracie-abrams/1450554836), [Conan Gray](https://music.apple.com/th/artist/conan-gray/1168567308), and [Sabrina Carpenter](https://music.apple.com/th/artist/sabrina-carpenter/390647681)—you name it! As for Thai artists, I know some, but they’re mostly older ones that people don’t really listen to anymore.
